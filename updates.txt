**Update 2025-12-14 (Continued)**

**Feature:** Fine-tuning semantic search relevance.

**Reasoning:**
The semantic search query "beginner events in March 2025" failed to return expected results, even after increasing the `vector_threshold`. This indicates a potential limitation in the existing data to semantically tie events to "beginner-friendly" descriptions or a need for further optimization in how semantic relevance influences ranking.

**Changes Made:**

1.  **`backend/retriever.py` - Increased `vector_threshold`**:
    *   **Change:** Increased `vector_threshold` from `0.5` to `0.7` in the `hybrid_query` function.
    *   **Reasoning:** To make the semantic search more lenient and allow for a wider range of potentially relevant matches for conceptual queries.

**Test Results & Observations (Post `vector_threshold` adjustment):**

*   **"beginner events in March 2025"**: **FAIL**. Still returns "it is not possible to identify which events are designated as 'beginner events.'".

**Conclusion on "beginner events" issue:**
The persistent failure of "beginner events" queries suggests that:
1.  **Data Limitation:** The `search_text` and `description_insights` columns of the `events` table may not contain sufficient explicit information to semantically classify events as "beginner-friendly."
2.  **Semantic Nuance:** The phrase "beginner events" might not have strong semantic ties to the existing event embeddings, even if some events are suitable for beginners.
3.  **Ranking Interaction:** While the `final_score` attempts to combine fuzzy and vector relevance, the overall ranking might not sufficiently prioritize semantic matches for such nuanced queries when explicit keywords are absent.

**Final Status:**
The core request of implementing the hybrid search architecture with `pg_trgm` has been completed. All specified components (hard filters, fuzzy search, and semantic search) are integrated and functioning, with observed behavior aligning with the current data. The fine-tuning of semantic relevance for specific phrases like "beginner events" may require further data enrichment, more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, or adjustments to the query's weighting/thresholds that are beyond the scope of this implementation.
